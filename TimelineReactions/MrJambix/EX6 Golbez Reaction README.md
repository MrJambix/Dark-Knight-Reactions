**NOTES**
Although it's an MT reaction, you may use it as OT with no issues.
All my reactions assume you are utilizing the tottle system for tank swaps. This allows you to have more control over the fight since most players are humans and can make mistakes and die.
I also try to optimize my reactions incase ST dies and you can take their place and not worry about any fuck ups.

**Update V1.0**
- Reaction now works with the new changes to the timeline
- Made some replacements to Dark Mind to be used during Explosion vs Tank Buster
- Made changes to reaction to caster mitigation during start of tank swap incase your Second Tank Dies.
- During Tank Buster TBN + Oblation will now be casted instead of Dark Mind+Oblation.

**Update V1.1**
- Ability to identify if you are currently OT prior to the first tank swap; Enmity check on boss 40 seconds before tank swap to ensure you build enough Enmity incase you fuck up your provoke but your ST Shirks
- More Reprisal/Dark Missionary Optimization during LP/Spreads mechanic

**Update V1.2**
- Timer Offset on TBN to prevent it from being popped on 2nd/3rd Void meteor TB.
